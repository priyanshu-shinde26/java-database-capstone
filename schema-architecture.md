Section 1: Architecture summary --This Spring Boot application uses a layered architecture, combining both Model-View-Controller (MVC) and RESTful principles to handle different types of user interaction. The user interface is split, with Thymeleaf templates powering the Admin and Doctor dashboards for a server-rendered view, while a set of REST APIs provides a decoupled, data-driven experience for all other modules.For data persistence, the application uses a polyglot approach, interacting with two distinct databases to leverage their strengths. It connects to a MySQL database for relational data like patient, doctor, appointment, and administrative details, using JPA entities for a clean, object-oriented data access layer. For the more flexible, document-based data like prescriptions, it uses a MongoDB instance with document models. All client requests are directed to a common service layer, which contains the application's core business logic. This service layer then interacts with the appropriate repository—either for MySQL or MongoDB—to complete the data operation.
Section 2: Numbered flow of data and control--
1.A user initiates a request by accessing either a web page like the AdminDashboard (handled by Thymeleaf) or a module that uses a REST API (like a mobile client).
The request is received by the appropriate Spring controller, which acts as the entry point for the application's logic.
The controller delegates the request to the common service layer, where business logic is applied and the necessary data operation is identified.
The service layer then determines which database is needed for the operation and calls the relevant repository.
The correct repository (either the JPA-based one for MySQL or the document-based one for MongoDB) interacts with its corresponding database to execute the query.
The database returns the requested data (or a confirmation of the operation) back to the repository. The MySQL data is automatically mapped to JPA entities, while MongoDB data is mapped to document models.
The service layer receives the data from the repository, potentially performs additional processing, and sends it back to the controller. The controller then returns the final response to the user, either as a rendered Thymeleaf template or as a RESTful response (like JSON).
